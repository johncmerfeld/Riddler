# FootballCards

## [The challenge](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/id-like-to-use-my-riddler-lifeline/)

From Jerry Meyers, a conundrum timed to kick off the football season!

My son recently started collecting Riddler League football cards and informed me that he planned on acquiring every card in the set. It made me wonder, naturally, how much of his allowance he would have to spend in order to achieve his goal. His favorite set of cards is Riddler Silver; a set consisting of 100 cards, numbered 1 to 100. The cards are only sold in packs containing 10 random cards, without duplicates, with every card number having an equal chance of being in a pack.

Each pack can be purchased for $1. If his allowance is $10 a week, how long would we expect it to take before he has the entire set?

What if he decides to collect the more expansive Riddler Gold set, which has 300 different cards?

## Strategy

This one was thankfully quite simple!

But if there's one thing that's stubbornly part of my brand, it's Monte Carlo simulations. Let's see what happens when we just "play the game."
